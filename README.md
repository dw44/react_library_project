Part of "The Odin Project" curriculum.

Project specification: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/frameworks

A redo of a previous project, utilizing React instead of the original's vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Includes functionality to Add books to the library, remove them, and edit their read status. All book data and it's manipulation is handled through "Redux". 

A copy of all book related data is also stored in local storage, and is updated any time changes are made to the data through the app, so the data is persistent and loaded into the app's state when the app is loaded.  

To add a book, click on the 'Add Book' button on the navbar. To hide the form, click on the button when it says 'Hide Form'.

Use the 'Change Read Status' and 'Delete Book' buttons on individual book cards to remove the book from the Redux store and local storage, or change it's 'read' status in both places.
